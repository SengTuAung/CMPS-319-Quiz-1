<h1> About </h1>

<h2> Revisit history through food on your palette</h2>
<p> Cafe Wang was founded in December 2015 and it took 2 years to develop its unique design and approach to Chinese culture. 
Operation began in June 2018. The name is derived from the founder's family name, Wang, and the hope that the Wang family's secret Chinese recipes are infused with American cuisine culture to create a perfect combination.
 In fact, the logo is an infusion of the east and west cultures, like many of the restaurant’s dishes, with a combination of Chinese calligraphy, Chinese stamps, Chinese characters and English letters.</p>
 
 <p>The restaurant's ambiance is a trendy, artistic and industrial look. A young team of designers developed the style. 
 All of the restaurant's furniture, dinnerware, and various equipment was all created and shipped from China.
 The philosophy is that all these components are vital to the restaurant, it's not only about the recipes, it has to be an entire creative experience and the right environment to really enjoy your meal.</p>
